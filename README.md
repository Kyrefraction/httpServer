To get this to work you'll need to:

1 add gson-2.2.4.jar to the build path

2 add sqlite-jdbc-3.14.2.1.jar to the build path

3 configure project build path access rules, add an accessible access rule, "com/sun/net/httpserver/**"

4 add an SQLite file to your directory called "empdb.sqlite" that contains the employee information (you can change the name if you also change the name in the code)
